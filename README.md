# Tdispo

Tdispo is a Doodle like web application to record participations to events.

## Pitch

Administrators can create events. Events have a title, a date, a description and a status.

A status has a name and a color. Administrators can define them.

A static list of guests is managed by administrators. A guest has a name and an email address. A guest can participate to an event.

Participations connect guests to events. A participation tells whether the guest will assist or not.
